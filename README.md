# SimplifiedQuadtree

This project was done as part of my coursework for CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II. This includes the implementation of all functions in the "Quad.c" file. 

To run the interactive driver:
1. Choose "6 - Load Image" and type in the name of the file (.pgm)
   Note: sample images are included (test.pgm, point.pgm, wheel.pgm)
2. Choose "0 - Insert new Quad" to insert the quad on the image
3. You can either insert all quads manually by repeating step two, or split the current quad using "7 - Split Tree"
